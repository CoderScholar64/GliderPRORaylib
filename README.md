# Glider PRO raylib Port
This project is yet another porting attempt for Glider Pro.
This project aims to be coded in standard C99 as much as possible. This project is to make it easier to port to things like MS-DOS or other low-spec systems. If you want a fully featured Glider PRO port with the map editor and everything, play [Aerofoil](https://github.com/elasota/Aerofoil).

## Goals
 * Port this source code to standard C99. 
 * Clean up the source code.
 * Make this project easier to port.
 * Recreate the GUI that would be TV and gamepad-friendly.
 * Make this project work with GPF format developed by the Aerofoil Author [elasota](https://github.com/elasota/Aerofoil). Rationale: Resource Forks are obsolete.
 * Update rendering code for modern computers
 * Remove the map editor. Rationale: Aerofoil already has that feature, and it would simplify this code base.
